## index.html and style.css were refactored to meet accessibility standards

-  The motive of this project is to add semantic HTML elements, find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, add accessible alt attributes, heading attributes
are in sequential order, and view the title element
to find a concise, descriptive title
